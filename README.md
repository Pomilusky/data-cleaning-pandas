## Introduction:
This project is aimed to study reported shark attacks. To do so we are using a Data Base sorted in kaggle, you can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks).

Excited to know all about shark attacks? How many shark attacks are reported per year? How has this rate evolved during history? 

Where is it more likely for a shark to attack you? (Spoiler, no shark attacks in the coasts of Northern Norway, safe to swin thereðŸ¥¶)

And what are the features that make you more appetizing to a Shark?

## HipotizingðŸ¤”:
Here are my hypotesis:
1. The gorwth during history will increase At some point we are going to observe a huge growth, as most cases weren't reported in the past, and at some point humans considered reporting this data, for some reason, interesting. Also, it will probably correlated with the global population growth. 

2. I belive most of the attacks will be near the tropics.

3. Men in between their 20's and their 40's are going to be the most common prey.
